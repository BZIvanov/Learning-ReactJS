# ðŸ§ª Testing in React

Testing ensures that your components work as expected and helps prevent bugs during refactoring.

## Learning React Testing Library (RTL)

**For details about how to test using Jest and RTL check out this repository [RTL repository](https://github.com/BZIvanov/Learning-React-Testing-Library).**

## Recommended Library: React Testing Library

[React Testing Library (RTL)](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) is the de facto standard for testing React components. It encourages good testing practices by focusing on user behavior rather than component internals.

### Why React Testing Library?

- Promotes testing from the user's perspective.
- Avoids reliance on implementation details.
- Works well with Jest (default test runner for Create React App).
- Lightweight and simple to use.
