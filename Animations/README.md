# Animations

## 3rd party library

[Motion Framer](https://motion.dev/) is example library with which you could do animations.

## Animations package

**react-addons-css-transition-group** - is a nice package for animating react elements, for example when rendering a list or removing items 1 by 1.

## Another animation package

If we are using some animations where we have control with React over displaying and hiding them, we might experience issues, because on hiding for example React will not wait for the animation to finish. As a solution we can use the following package.

```bash
npm install react-transition-group --save
```
