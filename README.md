## Searching in folders

With **ctrl+shift+f** you can search in the whole directory opened with VS code.

## Chrome specific feature
If we have the console drawer open, which shows the console in every tab in the dev tool, from the three dots icon we can activate the **Coverage** tab.

## Animations package

**react-addons-css-transition-group** - is a nice package for animating react elements, for example when rendering a list or removing items 1 by 1.
